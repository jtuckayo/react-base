# CORS Error Fix Applied âœ…

## What was the problem?

Your React app is running on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port), but the server was configured to only allow CORS requests from `http://localhost:3000` (Create React App's default port).

## What I fixed:

Updated the server's CORS configuration in `server/server.js` to allow both ports:

```javascript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: ["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:5173"], // React app URLs (CRA and Vite)
    credentials: true,
  })
);
```

## Next Steps:

1. **Restart your server** for the changes to take effect:

   ```bash
   cd server
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Refresh your React app** in the browser

3. **Test the authentication** - the CORS error should now be resolved!

## Why this happened:

- **Vite** (modern React tooling) uses port 5173 by default
- **Create React App** uses port 3000 by default
- The server was only configured for CRA's port
- Now it supports both development environments

The authentication system should now work perfectly! ðŸš€
